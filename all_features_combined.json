The abnormal movements come in form of convulsions at night which are generalised tonic clonic happening for 15-20 minutes and associated with urine and faecal incontinence. Also reports no known precipitating factors. No history of fevers. Also associated with post-ictal phase of loss of consciousness for about 15 minutes.

He was admitted on Ward 11, multiple investigations done and was diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome (Severe myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy) and viral encephalitis. He was managed with IV acyclovir and Phenobarbitone then discharged on Syrup Sodium Valproate at 33 mg/kg/day with Cefixime and Ambrodil. Mother reports no improvement. He still gets breakthrough seizures and has regressed in milestones. He was initially able to walk on objects but he currently cannot sit without support. He was born normally, cried immediately and had achieved age-appropriate milestones till 9/12 months of age.    O/E: FGC (Fair General Condition), febrile to touch (Temp: 37.9 ?
